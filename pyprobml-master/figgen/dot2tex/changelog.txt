      and fdp, when the input is in plain dot format. 
    + Added the special d2toptions graph attribute. Allows you to specify 
      dot2tex options in command line format.
    * Added a dot2tex wrapper script and changed setup.py to make it fully
      compatible with both setuptools and distutils. A dot2tex module will

    + Added a topath edge attribute for using TikZ' to paths (tikz and 
      pgf only).
    * Information about the selected output format is now stored in the graph
      generated in preprocessing mode. No longer necessary to specify an 
      output format in the final run.
