Dot2tex is a tool for converting graphs rendered by Graphviz to formats
that can be used with LaTeX. 

The purpose of dot2tex is to give graphs generated by Graphviz a more 
LaTeX friendly look and feel. This is accomplished by converting xdot 
output from Graphviz to a series of TikZ and PGF, or PSTricks commands. 
This approach allows:

    * Typesetting labels with LaTeX, allowing mathematical notation.
    * Using native PSTricks and PGF/TikZ commands for drawing arrows.
    * Using backend specific styles to customize the output

Installation
============

Before you install dot2tex you have to have a working Python environment 
installed on your system. Dot2tex has been developed and tested with 
Python 2.4, but it will probably run fine using Python 2.3. In addition 
you'll need the following modules:

    * pyparsing (http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/). A recent version is required.
      Older version like for instance 1.3.2 does not work with dot2tex.
    * pydot (http://dkbza.org/pydot.html)
    * preview (http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/preview.html)
      A stand-alone part of the preview-latex/AUCTeX bundle. 
      Required for preprocessing graphs with LaTeX.

From source
-----------

Download a zip or a tarball from the download_ page. It is also available on 
CTAN_. Unpack the file to a directory and run ``python`` on the ``setup.py`` 
file::

    $ python setup.py install

This will create a dot2tex module in your Python module directory and a wrapper
script in your ``SCRIPTS`` directory. Note that a few warnings will be 
displayed. You can safely ignore them. The warnings are shown because there is 
some extra information in the ``setup.py`` file that distutils does not understand.

Using easy_install
------------------

The easiest way to install dot2tex is to use `easy_install`_::

    $ easy_install dot2tex

The command will locate dot2tex and download it automatically. Note that 
documentation and examples are not installed by default. `Easy_install`_ 
will also create a wrapper script or EXE file for you and install dependencies 
if necessary.
